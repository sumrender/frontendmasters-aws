above is the url of bucket
pasting it while creating cloudfront distribution in origin domain


if we have a custom domain, we need to have 
custom ssl certificate for https,
but if we are not using custom domain,

cloudfront will generate its own url, with 
https enabled, only downside is the url 
name, but awesome now for learning purposes,

no money spent on domain names.

A rich sammy is a happy sammy.


next stem is OAI: Origin Access Identity
  In this basically we are locking down the 
  bucket, essentially only letting cloudfront
  access stuff from the bucket

// BUT I AM SKIPPING THE OAI PART
// and cloudfront routing
