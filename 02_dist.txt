build any react project with client routing

upload it to bucket using aws cli

make sure that static site hosting is on

you will notice that client side routing fails

one way to bypass is to set error page
route to index.html itself, which 
will resolve the routing but it is 
a temporary fix only, as server returns
404


next process for going to www.superawesome.click
create another bucket and redirect it to
superawesome.click bucket
